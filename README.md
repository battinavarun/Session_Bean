Session Bean Project (EJB)
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) with a focus on Session Beans (Stateless and Stateful) in a Java EE environment. The project provides examples of how business logic can be encapsulated in session beans, which are reusable components deployed in an application server.

Session beans are used to implement business logic for a distributed application, and this project showcases both Stateless and Stateful session beans.

Features
Stateless Session Bean: Handles independent, non-conversational operations.
Stateful Session Bean: Maintains state across multiple client requests within a session.
Basic business logic implemented using session beans.
Technologies Used
Java EE (Jakarta EE)
EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)
JPA (Java Persistence API)
Apache TomEE / WildFly (or any JEE-compliant server)
Maven (optional for build and dependency management)
Requirements
JDK 8 or higher
A Java EE-compliant server (e.g., Apache TomEE, WildFly)
Maven (if using Maven for build)
IDE with Java EE support (e.g., Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers, IntelliJ IDEA)
